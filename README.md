# Avengers Assemble!


https://jsf5077.github.io/Avengers-Assemble/

Welcome to a classic game of Hangman, with with a "Marvel"ous twist. Can you assemble all of the Avengers and stop Thanos?

Like a traditional game of Hangman, the user must guess letters to fill in the blanks until all the blanks are filled or the user runs out of guesses. The words built into the game are chosen at random each round. Currently, the words can be repeated in the game even after the user has guessed that word, but I plan to return to this game in the future to work this issue out. The game as a whole is complete when all words have been guessed correctly.
